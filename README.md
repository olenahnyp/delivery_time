Research project:
## Analysis of delivery time and its dependence on various factors

In this project we applied our statistical skills to test the hypothesis we made. You can watch the whole research in the attached files. Here are some conclusions.

## Conclusions
Our first hypothesis was that people over 30 deliver food longer than people under 30 because younger people are more willing to speed up. We tested different types of vehicles: motorcycle, bicycle, scooter and electric scooter. No matter what vehicle it was, younger delivery people were quicker than older people. The biggest difference was when we tested riding a bicycle. Our hypothesis was not rejected because in every case younger people were quicker.

The next hypothesis we tested was the delivery speed of different types of food: meals. drinks, buffet and snacks. We assumed that meals are the longest to deliver because we need time to cook them and snacks are the quickest to deliver because they are already ready. Sadly, our hypothesis was only partially true. Meals are delivered longer than snacks but not longer than buffet or drinks. The same with snacks. Snacks are delivered quicker than meals but not quicker than buffet or drinks. In general, mean time of waiting was not significantly different.

So, we can say that mostly delivery time depends not on what you order but who delivers it to you.
